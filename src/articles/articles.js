        monday1: `Starting out the first day of Hell Week out strong, I woke up at 10 a.m., grabbed a quick lunch from John Jay and headed to Butler 209 for a study sesh.
        I finished what I planned to review around 6 p.m. with a few breaks for water and snacks in between, and I was ready for some dinner.`,
        monday2:`I thought it would be best for me to go somewhere local, but my foodie senses were asking me to not return to the dining halls for dinner. 
        I decided to go to Le Monde, a French restaurant that is walking distance from campus. I ordered take-out and brought it back to my dorm, and enjoyed a filling meal. 
        I felt satisfied, and my only complaint was the slightly higher than expected price of the items. Still, I did feel like I had a worthwhile French culinary experience.`,
        monday3:`After eating dinner, I was tired so I decided to call it a night after reading one last section for review. First day of Hell Week is over!

        tuesday1: `Day 2 of studying all day! Tuesday I dedicated some time to studying for my history seminar, Feast and Famine: Food and Environment in Chinese History. 
        This multifaceted, discussion-based course covering anthropology, history, and environmental science (and food!) is one of my most interesting classes. 
        The weather was really nice, so after a couple hours I took a wellness check at Riverside Park. The fresh air and sunshine was really rejuvenating and I decided to make the most of my time there. 
        I brought some notes so I could continue grinding on the outdoors, but it really made me feel better about this stressful week.`,
        tuesday2:`
        On the way back to campus, I stopped by JJ for a quick lunch, but immediately felt guilty for scarfing down two baskets of greasy curly fries and a burger. I really should have chosen something healthier or cooked in my dorm kitchen, 
        but JJ’s can be so irresistible. After lunch was another multi-hour grind session, this time in Butler because it was close by. 
        `,
        tuesday3:`In the evening, I decided to reward myself with some quality time with friends at Chelsea Market. It took some time to gather everyone and reach the popular food-heaven, and by the time we got there we were ravenous. 
        We sampled our way from one side of Chelsea Market to the other, stopping at every restaurant along the way to get a taste of their menu, and at midnight we headed back to campus. 
        It was a fun night, but I was a bit anxious about how much time I spent out. 
        More studying ahead!

        wednesday1:`Day 3, rise and shine! I used up so much time last night commuting and waiting in lines at Chelsea Market so today was definitely a grind day. 
        I started the day in Avery Library, studied there for a few hours, and decided to move to NoCo for a fresh, new study environment. 
        I realized NoCo was not the right move as I ended up getting distracted by the bustle and wasted a lot of valuable time. To make up for the time lost, I decided on another study sesh later that night. 
        I was craving ramen and the thought of having dining hall food for dinner made my craving even stronger. Usually, I would find a ramen shop to dine-in at but with the pandemic and Hell Week, I didn’t have the opportunity. 
        I rushed back to my dorm for some quick, gourmet late-night study fuel. The Ramen Museum ramen kits I ordered earlier this week arrived today, and I prepared the Black Mayu Pork Kimchi one right away.`,
        wednesday2:`I tried their ahijen addition, and I was blown away. Adding the ahijen to the broth midway through finishing the bowl completely changed the flavor of the ramen from kimchi to a creamy curry flavor. 
        It was like having two bowls of ramen in one! The restaurant-quality came in a frozen package and was easy to store, so I saved them for the next time my ramen cravings came in. After clean-up, I studied in my room until I finished what I had planned for the day at 3 a.m. 
        Goodnight! `,

        thursday1:`After the change in environment from studying at the library yesterday, I decided to stay inside all day to study today. A couple of hours passed, and I was starting to feel a little restless so I made a matcha latte to destress. I really love matcha, and this recipe is so easy. 
        After I finish up in the kitchen I feel ready to hit the books for a couple more hours. 
        `,
        thursday2:`
        For lunch, I made a quick grilled cheese sandwich and hopped onto a Zoom call to meet with a study group. Working with friends is always a lot of fun for me, but after an hour it’s obvious we’re chatting a lot more than we’re studying. 
        To stay on track, I said my goodbyes and logged off the call to focus a little better. 
        While it’s less fun to do work alone, I figured that if I worked really hard for a couple of hours, I could take some time to relax for dinnertime.`,

        thursday3:`For dinner, I didn’t really feel like going out. After a full day on the grind, I needed something quick and easy so I decided to treat myself to some pasta from Serafina, which I ordered from UberEats. 
        While ordering can be really convenient, it’s a bit pricey so I usually try to only order every once and a while. 
        I place the order, and after almost an hour of waiting, it finally arrives. My pasta was very flavorful and yummy, but still arrived later than expected and not as warm as I would have liked. 
        Normally I wouldn’t have minded, but after a day of studying I just wanted to treat myself to something nice. I ended up just reheating the pasta in the microwave, wishing I had just cooked myself something in the first place. `

        friday1:`Friday rolls by and I felt pretty accomplished by the amount of studying I’ve done and how I kept my wellness in check throughout the week.`,
        friday2:
        `A week in the life of a foodie at Columbia? Definitely have to stop by Hungarian Pastry Shop for a quick coffee! The cozy atmosphere always makes me feel extra productive, and hopefully I can get my CC final reflection paper done when I’m there. 
        As usual, I ordered the croissant, a slice of carrot cake, and a hot cappuccino. The combination of the fluff of the croissant, the smooth texture of the carrot cake, and the rich foam of the cappuccino was absolutely heavenly. 
        It really helped power me through my essay. However, with barely any real nutrition value, I felt hungry soon after. Hopefully I will get something more filling for dinner later. 
        `,
        friday3:`My roommates and I decided to have a more exciting evening, planning to do something social together and treat ourselves. We discussed whether we want to go downtown for a celebratory meal before finals week and the weekend of studying actually rolls by, or order in. 
        I remember my positive experience with Ramen Museum NYC and the leftover ramens I had ordered and stored, and suggested a roommate bonding night where we cook our food and eat together. 
        It’s been a stressful week, and all I want is a relaxing night-in making easy, quick, and heartwarming ramen with the people I love. 
        `,
        friday4:`My roommates and I have a great time, catching up on our weeks and telling each other about our most stressful days the next week. 
        As we’re cooking the ramen, we discuss when we’ll all be finished with finals and can finally relax and take our minds off of school. 
        `,
        friday5:`The texture of the noodles, the richness of the broth, wow! Even though I couldn’t go to a physical ramen restaurant in the city, it felt as if I transformed my kitchen into a restaurant and I was the head chef. 
        Better yet, the whole process only took about 20 minutes, and while it takes longer instant ramen, it’s well worth it. 
        As we sit down to enjoy a restaurant-quality ramen, I am very happy I got to spend time with my roommates before finals week approaches. 
        As our tummies fill with the warm broth of the ramen, I’m grateful that tonight’s cooking has brought us closer together as not only a living unit, but also as friends.

        intro: `It’s that time of year we all dread: Reading Week, or as more famously known, Hell Week. 
        I know how stressful it can be staying up till 3 a.m. cooped up in your room or Butler Ref 
        cramming months’ worth of material into a single week without having time for much else. But, 
        as a self-proclaimed food enthusiast on a never-ending quest for delicious finds, I won’t let 
        Hell Week stop me. I’ll show you how I satisfy my cravings for good food while studying for 
        finals at Columbia. This is a Hell Week in the life of a foodie.`,
